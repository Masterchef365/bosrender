# Book of Shaders renderer
- [x] Make an offline renderer for [Book of Shaders](http://thebookofshaders.com/) programs
    * Programmable dimensions, frames, framerate
    * Output PNGs
- [ ] Add the ability to define custom rendering rects
    * 2D transform matrix (2x3)
- [x] ~~Ffmpeg/raw frame interface from stdout~~ turns out this sucks
- [ ] Allow for input textures (an extension to the book of shaders)
- [x] Multiple frames in flight (to better utilize the GPU)

# Ideas
* Copy code from ga1axy
